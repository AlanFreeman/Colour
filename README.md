This folder contains the code for a model of signal processing in the upstream visual system.

The code runs in Matlab. Ensure all .m and .mat files are on the Matlab path.

Run runCol. This should plot a map of cone locations.

Now edit runCol. The first switch statement controls the analysis. You just ran case array.x.y: try some other cases.

All cases set metadata used by stream, which executes the analyses. See Guide to stream and streamTute.m for short tutorials on stream.
